I love scripting

bread is eaten by geese

geese are god's mistake

I don't actually know that, I've probably only seen geese 5 times in my life

but everyone says they're evil

and I, like an absolute fool, believes what everyone says

anyway, it all started when I was born

because I, like an idiot, developed emotions
